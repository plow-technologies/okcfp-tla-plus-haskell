* TLA+ and Haskell

This repo demonstrates using TLA+ specs as a way of
being the 'just before' language to design a spec
that a program can be based on.

It then goes on to use Haskell with mtl and quickcheck
to define a highly testable interface and example
spec.

** Using nix to build the model.
The haskell project can be ran by using 
#+begin_src bash
nix-shell ./nix/shell.nix
#+end_src

To get into a proper nix shell.
From this point, run:
#+begin_src bash
  cabal v2-update
  cabal v2-configure
  cabal v2-build
#+end_src
